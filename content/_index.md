Welcome to the home of the Dallas Fort Worth Site Reliability Engineering meetup group. 

## Goals

* Proliferate the adoption of SRE in a healthy way
* Act as an educational resource

## Who we are

We are a group of like-minded engineers from systems engineering (SE) and software engineering (SWE) backgrounds who enjoy sharing and gaining knowledge together. We're a meetup focused on both the cultural and technical aspects of SRE.

## Where?

We currently meet at The Home Depot on the **first Wednesday** of every month, minus January and February. See our [Meetup page for details](https://www.meetup.com/DFW-Site-Reliability-Engineering/). You can also join us on [Slack here](http://dfwsre.slack.com/)!  Submit your email address [here](https://dfwsre-slack-invitations.fly.dev/) for an invite!

## New to SRE?

Firstly, welcome! The SRE community is quite small but is a community of growing influence. SRE is very similar to practices such as Production Engineering at Facebook and it's implementations vary by organization. While there is no one way to do SRE, the core tenants are what really define the role and practice.

Be sure to check out [our resources page](/resources).
