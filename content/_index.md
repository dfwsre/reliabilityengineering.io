Welcome to the home of the Dallas Fort Worth Site Reliability Engineering meetup group. DFW SRE is a practictioners meetup focusing on generating concensus through engineer engagement and representing DFW SRE's as a whole.

While our focus is on DFW SRE's we realize our impact can be greater than that. Some additional areas of influence:

* Organizational adoption
* Developing / enforcing standards
* Pay & benefits advocacy
